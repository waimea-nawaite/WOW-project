# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

Need to fix a problem with the online form my Mum has to use for WOW so I am making my own version with what she needs it to have for it to be useful
Replace this text with a clearly stated problem or need that exists that your project will attempt to solve / fulfil.


## End-User Requirements

Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements.


## Proposed Solution

I want to create a system that is easy and quick to use because WOW workers have to go through lots of different costumes everyday so a easy way to say if the costume is good for the show it will save lots of time. I will make it have options for what problems the specific costume has for a quick select and move on
